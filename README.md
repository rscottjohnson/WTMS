# Web Task Management System (WTMS)
WTMS is a web based task management application that a team of developers could utilize to create, edit, track the completion of, and delete tasks as part of a workgroup. 

## Project Motivation
WTMS is the project chosen for use as a means of applying the concepts learned in the East Carolina University (ECU) CSCI 6600 *Database Management System* course.

## Development Notes
